    <code>A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.</code> 

    <p>Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color choices.

    <pre>That was also an example of a nested command.</pre>
